## Hello! My name is Vanhi Chava and I am a data science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This repository is a collection of my work in data analysis and statistical modeling in R. I worked through preforming statistical tests, manipulating data, and creating graphical models. My goal is to explore biostatistics and make an impact in true research. The work I have displayed in this repository contains some data from clinical settings where I try to emulate the conditions of a clinical trial to showcase my skills in R. Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio.
